I'm Tristan Hanon, an agricultural economist with Dairy Program in the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service. I provide analysis to support the Federal Milk Marketing Order system and work to facilitate the efficient marketing of milk and dairy products.

I received my PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from UC Davis, where I focused on agricultural policy, international trade, and structural modeling.

I am deeply interested in understanding the way things works, and strive to view the world through different perspectives in order to understand it better.
