I am an agricultural economist and spend my days analyzing data, working on reports, and generally providing insights to support our operations. I enjoy what I do quite a lot.\nI’ve recently been focusing a lot of my time on how we can do what we do better. In some cases this has been automating tasks that were previously done manually. In other cases it is looking at how we can use new tools to improve our existing output. And of course, there are always opportunities to do more and better modeling.\nI am also working on revisions to the main paper from my dissertation, which is under a Revise & Resubmit from Quantitative Economics. My coauthor, Pierre Mérel, and I are just getting started on the revision process, so it is early days yet."
